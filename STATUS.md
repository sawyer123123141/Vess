## Step 1 done — eyes that blink

`python main.py` opens a window showing the 64x64 face at 8x nearest-neighbour.
It blinks irregularly, wanders its gaze, and morphs between all five eye
shapes in `moods.json`.

Built: `state.py`, `output/face.py`, `output/animator.py`, `output/display.py`,
`main.py`. 526 lines total, largest file 164.

Keys in the preview window:

- `1`-`5` — set mood (order follows `moods.json`: neutral, happy, sad,
  annoyed, curious)
- `t` — cycle a fake `person_pos` (off, left, top, right, bottom) so the
  tracking path works before `camera.py` exists
- `q` / Esc — quit

### What each piece does

- **`state.py`** — the `State` dataclass exactly as `PLAN.md` specifies, plus
  an `RLock` and a `locked()` context manager. The lock is set in
  `__post_init__` rather than declared as a field, so it stays out of the
  repr and equality.
- **`face.py`** — pure renderer. Takes a flat dict of numbers and returns a
  64x64x3 `uint8` array. Knows nothing about time or `State`.
- **`animator.py`** — owns time. Reads `State` under its lock, never writes.
- **`display.py`** — `DisplayTarget` base with `show()`; `PreviewWindow` is
  the only implementation. The websocket preview (step 3) and the LED panel
  (step 8) become more targets, not edits to this file.
- **`main.py`** — load config, build the three objects, loop at 30fps.

### Design notes

- **Eye shapes are a parameter vector, not five drawing routines.** All five
  entries in `EYE_SHAPES` share the same keys (`w`, `h`, `radius`, `slant`,
  `arc`, `pupil`, `pupil_r`, `pupil_y`), so a mood change is a componentwise
  lerp. Colour rides along as `r`/`g`/`b` in the same dict, so one easing loop
  handles shape and colour together.
- **Easing is exponential**, tau 0.133 (~95% within the 0.4s the plan asks
  for), rather than a timed ramp. Retargeting mid-ease stays smooth instead of
  restarting.
- **Edges are antialiased.** The shapes are drawn from signed distance fields
  with a one-pixel soft edge. The panel is full RGB per pixel, so a partly lit
  edge pixel is real output, not a resolution lie — and at 16px wide it is the
  difference between a curve and a staircase. The upscale in the preview stays
  strictly nearest-neighbour.
- **The pupil is a hole**, not a bright dot: eye body in the mood colour,
  pupil punched out to black. Highest contrast on an LED panel, and it shrinks
  to nothing as the lid closes so a blink ends on a solid line.
- **Gaze is one code path.** Idle picks from seven fixed fixation points, snaps
  to one, holds 1-3s, snaps again. A sub-pixel drift from two sine waves with
  no common period rides on top, so the eyes are never perfectly still. When
  `person_pos` is set it simply becomes the fixation point every frame; step 2
  replaces the fake key with the detector and nothing else changes.
- **Blinks** run 0.17s, shutting faster than they open, gap 2.2-6.0s scaled by
  the mood's `blink_rate`, with an 18% chance of a double blink.

### Measured

- `animator.tick()` costs **0.20 ms** against a 33.3 ms budget. Rendering is
  not going to be what makes the face freeze; blocking calls in the loop will
  be.
- Blink irregularity over a simulated 120s: 29 blinks, gaps 0.33-6.07s.

### Learned / surprising

- `cv2.destroyWindow` raises `cv2.error: NULL window` if the window is already
  gone — which it is whenever the user closes it with the title bar rather
  than pressing `q`. Every run that ended by clicking X exited code 1.
  `PreviewWindow.close()` swallows it.
- Shearing the whole eye box for `slant` reads as a brow angle, but the first
  values (2.5 and -3.0 px) turned a 7px-tall eye into a rotated sliver. 1.9
  and -2.1 read the same at a glance and stay eye-shaped.
- The happy arc is a circle subtracted from below. Its radius controls
  curvature and has to be *smaller* than the eye is wide (0.62 × w) or the arch
  comes out nearly straight.

## Open questions (new)

- **Who owns `state.color`?** The animator currently takes colour from the
  mood entry in `moods.json`, per `PLAN.md`'s "target: from state.mood". That
  leaves `state.color` unread. Step 6's `set_color` command needs a rule for
  which wins — override until the next mood change, or mood always wins.
  Decide before writing `commands.py`.
- **`config.json` `display.width`/`height` are unread.** `face.py` has 64x64
  as constants because the plan says render natively. Either the config keys
  go, or `face.py` reads them. No urgency.
- **Tracking is not mirrored.** A person at `person_pos.x = 0.1` makes the
  pupils go to the viewer's left. Whether that is correct depends on whether
  the camera image is mirrored — settle it against a real camera in step 2.
- **Mood decay is read-only.** The animator treats a mood as expired once
  `mood_until` has passed, but nothing writes `state.mood` back to `neutral`.
  Whoever sets moods in step 4 should decide whether the field gets reset.

## Verified working (environment, not code)

- Ollama + `qwen2.5:7b` — 100% GPU, 4.7GB, 4096 ctx, fast when warm
- Vision model — near-instant
- `faster-whisper` small int8 on CPU — 4.8s of audio in 2.1s
- Kokoro TTS on CPU — 0.75s cold, ~0.5s warm, `af_heart` voice

## Open questions (carried over)

- Panel mounting spot not decided (right of desk vs above). Doesn't block
  anything — camera position is independent.
- Voice choice not final. Kokoro ships several; currently `af_heart`.
